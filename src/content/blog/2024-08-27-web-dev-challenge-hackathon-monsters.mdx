## The prompt: monsters have arrived — build an app to help out in this new world!

What kind of monster is up to you! Maybe kaiju have emerged from the ocean. Maybe Pokémon are actually real. Maybe gremlins were discovered. Maybe cryptids finally got caught on camera. Make ‘em cute, make ‘em scary, make ‘em fun — your call!

And “help” is also up for interpretation. Maybe this is an exciting scientific opportunity and your app supports that exploration. Maybe you’re helping people survive monster attacks. Or maybe you’re building an app to remote operate a monster-hunting robot to save humanity (if you can build that in 4 hours, you’re my hero).

Apps must use [Convex][sponsor], [Clerk][sponsor2], and/or [Raycast][sponsor3] as part of the build. 


## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [Learn With Jason Discord](https://lwj.dev/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

We'll have devs from the Algolia team available to provide technical guidance as you're building.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://lwj.dev/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
</Aside>

Find an accountabilibuddy, get expert guidance from the Clerk, Convex, and Raycast teams, run your idea past Jason and other community members, and listen in to what the rest of the community is cooking up in this open call to kick off the hackathon.

RSVP to add it to your calendar:

  ¹ The time limit is intended to make this a quick project that can fit most schedules. That being said, if you decide to spend more time on this, we'll never let a silly thing like rules stand in the way of a good time.
